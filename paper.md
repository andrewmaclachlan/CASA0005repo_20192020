with title, author names and affiliations, containing a description of the module, a summary of its contents, a statement of need, and key references.
References should be included in a BibTeX file called paper.bib

JOSE papers should:

List all authors and affiliations.
Describe the submission, and explain its eligibility for JOSE.
Include a “Statement of Need” section, explaining how the submitted artifacts contribute to computationally enabled teaching and learning, and describing how they might be adopted by others.
For software submissions, describe the functionality of the software, usage and recent experience of use in teaching and learning situations.
For learning modules, describe the learning objectives, content, instructional design, and experience of use in teaching and learning situations.
Tell us the “story” of the project: how did it come to be?
Cite key references, including a link to the open archive of the sofware or the learning module.
JOSE welcomes submissions with diverse educational contexts. You should write your paper for a non-specialist reader. Your submission should probably be around 1000 words (or around two pages).

The goal is that someone reading the JOSE paper has enough information to decide if they’d be interested in adoping the learnig module or software. Readers will want to know how the content/software has been used, and how they would adopt it. They may also want to be persuaded that the authors have put careful work on creating the material, and have experience teaching with it.

JOSE papers contain a limited set of metadata, plus Summary & Reference sections. We explicitly do not publish long-form articles, because the scholarship represented by a JOSE article is contained in the software or learning modules themselves. Expected length is around 1000 words max.

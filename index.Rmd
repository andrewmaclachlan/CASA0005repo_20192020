# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the CASA0005 Geographic Information Systems and Science online pratical handbook. This website is hosted on GitHub and holds all the practical instructions and data. Data used within the practicals is available online, however occasionally websites can undergo maintenance or be inaccessible due to political factors such as government shutdowns.  

If you need the practical data you can access it from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/CASA0005repo) --- see 

Practical data is divided into the relevant sessions (e.g. prac1_data), although sometimes i'll refer to a dataset used within a previous week. 

The artwork used within this book has been produced by [allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst) and you can find all the images on Allison's [stats illustration GitHub repository](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)

::: {.infobox .tip data-latex="{note}"}
There is a lot of information within this practical book and **we do not expect you to read everything we link to**. You should attend each lecture, go through every practical and do some assicoated reading. 

This is a 15 credit module, equivalent to 150 hours of study (including the taught sessions). Outside of our lectures and practical sessions (3 hours a week) **you should be spending an extra 12 hours a week on this module**.

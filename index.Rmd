# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the CASA0005 Geographic Information Systems and Science online pratical handbook. This website is hosted on GitHub and holds all the practical instructions and data. Data used within the practicals is available online, however occasionally websites can undergo maintenance or be inaccessible due to political factors such as government shutdowns.  

If you need the practical data you can access it from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrewmaclachlan/CASA0005repo), this is explained in [Hello GIS]. 

Practical data is divided into the relevant sessions (e.g. prac1_data), although sometimes i'll refer to a dataset used within a previous week. 

The artwork used within this book has been produced by [allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst) and you can find all the images on Allison's [stats illustration GitHub repository](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)

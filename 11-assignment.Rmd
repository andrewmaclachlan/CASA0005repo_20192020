```{r echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

Listed below are some helpful website, books, datasets and tools you might find useful when completing your assignments.

## Examples of previous work

Closer to the assignment deadline we will release examples of good student projects from previous years as a tab on Moodle.

## Cool stuff to explore

New pcakages and functions that i've recently come across that are worth exploring..

* RStudio cloud: https://rstudio.cloud/ --- like RStudio but online, great for collaborating
* Animating plots: https://rpubs.com/jgleeson/ripple-effect

## Data lists

Awesome public datasets have a wide range all data (some geographic, some not): https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets

Robin Wilson has authored one of the most extensive data lists that i've come across: https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/

## Reading and writing critically

Hugh Kerans from Flinders Unversity, Adelaide has developed a range of materials to assist graduate students in producing effective reports and publications...check out his website and resouces here: https://www.ithinkwell.com.au/

The most useful templates for the assignments are the critical reading one:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height = "600pt", out.width = "800pt", cache=TRUE}
include_graphics('assignment/CriticalReading.pdf', auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", FALSE)
)
```

and questions to ask as you write a paper (or assignment):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height = "600pt", out.width = "800pt", cache=TRUE}
include_graphics('assignment/QuestionsToAskAsYouWriteAPaper.pdf', auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", FALSE)
)
```

You can download these from this website directly, my GitHub or Hugh's website.

Sven Åke Bjørke from the University of Agder also produced a few Youtube videos on academic writing and critical thinking that might be useful...

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NGMoW51jmA")
```

...And the paper ['How to write a paper for publicaiton'](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1444-2892.2000.00031.x)
